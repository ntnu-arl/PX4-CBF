# PX4-CBF

## Safety Filter Overview

This repository presents the instructions to use the embedded CBF-based safety filter for collision avoidance, designed for integration into the PX4 Autopilot.
The filter operates using real-time onboard range measurements and velocity estimation.
It is integrated into the PX4 position/velocity control loop and makes optimally minimal modifications to the acceleration setpoint to prevent collisions.

The safety filter is compatible with various range and depth sensors mounted on the multirotor, including, e.g., Intel RealSense D455 and alike, small-scale Time-of-Flight sensors, and 360Â° LiDARs.

When using a laterally constrained-FoV sensor, additional motion constraints can be applied within the CBF to restrict movement outside the sensor's FoV.
Note: this means, however, that the underlying CBF-QP lacks an analytical solution, necessitating the use of a solver. Additional computational resources will therefore be required on the controller board.

## Dependencies

### QP solver

As the safety filter relies on solving a minimization problem, the use of a solver is required (when FoV constrains are engaged).
We use a fork of [qpOASES](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/qpOASES).

*TODO explain why fork, mention dynamic memory allocation issues*

> Note: The qpOASES implementation is currently not working on the PixRacer Pro board and leads to firmware crashes. We are currently investigating this issue.

### Module In/Out Messages

Our method requires modified versions of [mavlink](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink) and [mavros](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros), that implements the relevant ROS and uORB messages.
Those messages include:
* List of 3D point of obstacles, split in chunks to cope for the mavlink maximum message size limitations.
* CBF debug message, exposing useful information for users through PX4 logs and ROS.

*TODO links to forks + explainations*

### Pointcloud downsampling

The safety filter is scalable wrt the number of obstacles consired as the avoidance problem is lumped into a single constraint.
Using the whole pointcloud is however redundant and implies a large computation overhead for computing the composite CBF.

We propose a Python [ROS1 module](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/cbf_pc_selector) for downsampling pointclouds, and selecting the N closest points to be sent to PX4.
The downsampling is achieved by selecting the minrange in a given number of angular bins.
The module can be installed normally through Catkin.

## Build / Install Instructions for Standard PX4 Flight Controllers

As the safety filter is implemented as part of the PX4 position controller, no additional changes are necessary aside from building and flashing the firmware (following instruction [here](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/dev_setup/building_px4.html)). Certain flight controllers may return memory errors due to the QP library used, these are simple solved by disabling unnecessary components.

## Build for ModalAI VOXL SDK

### Why a second fork

We also propose a realization of our implementation for the ModalAI VOXL SDK.
Our [public fork](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/voxl-px4/tree/cbf) of the [VOXL SDK](https://gitlab.com/voxl-public/voxl-sdk/services/voxl-px4) is based on the [SDF 1.2.0 release](https://gitlab.com/voxl-public/voxl-sdk/services/voxl-px4/-/tags/sdk-1.2.0).
We note that our fork contains no modification to the VOXL SDK itself, but change the px4-firmware submodule to [our modified PX4 implementation](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/modalai-px4-firmware), based on the older release used by VOXL.

### VOXL-speficic build instructions

## CBF parameters

Our PX4 implementation exposes tunable parameters that can be accessed through [QGC](https://qgroundcontrol.com/).

![Image of exposed parameters in QGC](resources/qgc_params.jpg)

The **CBF_ENABLE** flag allows user to engage or not the CBF safety filter.
If set to false, the position/velocity control loop will act exactly as in the vanilla PX4 implementation.

The most critical parameters that user may need to tune are presented in this table, along with a summary of their effect on the filter behavior.

| Parameter       | Range     | Effect when increasing       |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| CBF_EPSILON     | >0        | Larger avoidance radius      |
| CBF_KAPPA       | [10, 100] | Less smooth approximation    |
| CBF_GAMMA       | [10, 100] | Reacts to farther obstacles  |
| CBF_ALPHA       | [1, 3]    | Increased filter sensitivity |
| CBF_POLE0       | [-3, -1]  | Damped response              |
| CBF_LP_GAIN_OUT | [0, 1]    | Lesser accel. smoothing      |
| CBF_ALPHA_FOV   | [2, 8]    | More aggressive FoV response |
